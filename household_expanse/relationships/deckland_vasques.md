# Deckland Vasques

Location: Ceres
Affiliation: Dos Arriagas

## Relaitonship

Deckland was Izzy's handler-type person in Dos Arriagas. They got along well and drank together, Deckland would have been considered a close friend.

Izzy was uncomfortable with the violence that comes with gangs, so there was some tension there that wasn't awknowledged except in a deep drinking session.
