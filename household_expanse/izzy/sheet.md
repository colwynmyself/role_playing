### Talents

* Hacking        (Novice)

  When you succeed at an Intelligence (Cryptography) or Intelligence (Security) test, the GM can provide you with an
  extra item of information about the subject. Also, you can use the Intelligence (Technology) focus instead of
  Communication (Investigation) and Intelligence (Research) if the information you seek can be found in an accessible
  computer system.

* Improvisation  (Novice)

  You adapt to the situation. You can make an ability test that requires a specific focus, even if you don’t have that
  focus. You don’t gain the focus bonus to your roll and don’t generate SP on such rolls, but in investigations you are
  always considered to have a tangential focus.

* Misdirection   (Novice)

  As a major action, you can make a Communication (Deception) test opposed by an opponent’s Willpower
  (Self-Discipline); if you succeed, your opponent cannot perform stunts until the end of your next turn.

* Knowledge      (Novice)

  When you make a successful Intelligence test with a knowledge focus, the GM should give you an extra piece of
  information on the topic. A knowledge focus is any Intelligence focus with a description that starts with
  “Knowledge”, such as Business or Science. The GM determines the nature of the additional information and it may or
  may not be pertinent to the main question at hand.

### Equipment

* Pistol
* Padding
* Small drone
  * Toolkit (intelligence)

## Relationships

* The Crew of the Sommelier (1)

  Once per game session you can get as many SP as your Relationship rating to perform any stunt that would be
  in-character when it comes to helper other members of the crew of the Sommelier. You choose this after you see if you
  succeed on a test.

## Goals

* Become a legitimate person (as legitimate as a Belter can be)
