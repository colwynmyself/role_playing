# Trouble Off Tycho

## Trip to Tycho

We're deciding what to do with the guns from the Picas. We're going to move them to the Sommalier initially and talk to Theo Dardannus.

The weapons are: PDCs and a torpedo bay w/ 2 torpedos.

We bought a bunch of stuff, including a construction mech. I bought a small drone, padding, and an intelligence toolkit for the drone.

## Family in trouble

One of Chao's OPA contacts reached out to him and told us the Luongs have been in some trouble lately and we can take a job to help them out. Some research says they're probably pretty poor and a ship called the Tallship comes up with them. It's docked on Tycho.

They're ship is damaged and their running short on money. Their ship is insured by Thomas Katirci, but hs seems to have disappeared. Supposedly they live on Ganymede, the family has talked to the Martians about trying to find him to no avail.

They'd like us to go find Katirci and bring him back to Tycho to stand trial for fraud. The money he owes them wouldn't hurt either.

## To Ganymede

Katirci lives in a suite in TKO Holdings. TKO Holdings has a lot of real estate in its name to varying degrees of legit-ness. From Chao's research w/ his contacts he has links to Loca Griega and the less legit real estate holdings are money laundering for the gang.

We put an inquiry in for an insurance quote on our ship to see if we get anyting from him. We get nothing.

Vinicius Otero reaches out to Chao and says they have another job for you. There's a reasearcher in a biolab that has some pig embrios that would be useful for the belt. We have 24 hours to respond. Edit: We did not take it.

As we approach Ganymede we're stopped and told we need to wait 48 hours to dock. Addy tries to persuade them to let us land earlier but fucks it up so we're searched on the way in. They don't find anything and we convince them our goal on Ganymede is to check in on Katirca to make sure he's okay. This may play in later when we knock him out and kidnap him as our Chao's patient.

## Landing on Ganymede

After landing on Ganymede we went to the neighborhood we found for Katirci and looked around. We do some research and figure out he has a small office next to the docks. We decide to head to the office, on the way we notice 5 Loca Griega gangsters in a restaurant. When we get to the office we hack into the door, nothing notable pops out to us.

I reach out to Rodriguez in Doc Arriagas and ask him about Katirci and the Loca Griega. Katirci is generally hands-off since LG tells people to lay off and Pinkwater Security has increased their patrols in the area.

Heading back to Katirci's neighborhood we take a seat at a cafe and keep a lookout for anything weird. After a little while the 5 thugs we saw earlier head over to us, 4 stay outside the cafe and 1 comes and sits next to us. We ignore him and Nico heads to the door to try to knock it, but we're interrupted by 5 security guards entering the apartment followed by the thugs.

COMBAT - A firefight ensues. Towards the end of the firefight the station shakes and we all start running away towards our ship.
