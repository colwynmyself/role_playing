# The Picas

Shipping luxury goods from Titan to Tycho for some good money for Theo (Daddy) Dardannus.

We find a ship that's dead out in space. No reactor. About the same size as us, has some guns and no transponder.

## On the ship

We fight a drone and find Deckland Vasques in a room in the same hallway. He explains they were smuggling some Martian
drones and they somehow turned on and killed people on the ship.

## Getting Away

The ship Cybelle approached as we turned on the ship. They're a part of Dos Arriagas and were coming back for their
stuff. We successfully dropped the cargo and convinced them to let us get away with the ship.
