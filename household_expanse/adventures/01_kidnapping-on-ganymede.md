# Kidnapping in Ganymede

These notes are largely retroactive so a lot of detail is going to be missing. :shrug:

We regularly work with Amalthea Ambrosalas, the owner of which (Theo Dardannus) has told us to kidnap his son, Kai Dardannus.

At the point I started taking notes we're in a den of the OPA, just shot some OPA members to get his son out of there. We also stole some wine and cheese, because why not?

## Session 3

Run down the tunnels with Kai. Fight Monetta + 5 gang members at the end of the tunnels. Shot some of them, Monetta was taken out but not died. Pinkwater Security stopped the fight and took everyone to the station.
